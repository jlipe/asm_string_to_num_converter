# String to Number Converter Using x86 Assembly

Converts a signed input string to a 32 bit signed integer using x86 Assembly without the help of libraries.
The main program will run a test that prompts the user for 10 signed inputs and makes sure the inputs are valid.
The program then computes the sum and average of the inputted numbers and displays the results to the user. Program is written
such that all procedures do not reference global variables and all parameters are passed on the stack.
